# 3PlayerChess
Taking chess beyond the cartesian plane

My take on the standard chess game project. Timeline = 7 days of work.

This game will function on a board such as the "Roman Three Player Chess" Layout. At the time of starting the project , I expect the largest problems to be implementing a non-cartesian coordinate system and furthermoe developing the movesets for each piece (ESPECIALLY THE KNIGHT).
